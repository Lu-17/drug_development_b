# Multiple Ligand Docking Tutorial on leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 using compounds of safflower plant as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson’s Disease
# Introduction <h1> tag
  
  This tutorial aimed to conduct an in silico study, which involves using computer software to analyze biological data in vitro by mimicking what happens in vivo and using the plant as an alternative therapy, with a reduced side effect. The use of in silico technique is faster and reduces laboratory costs. The plant of interest is "Safflower". Safflower (*Carthamus tinctorius* L.) has long been used to treat cerebrovascular diseases in China. This plant contains flavonoids, which are effective in models of neurodegenerative disease (Ablat et al., 2016). The study was thus carried out by downloading the target protein (mutated LRRK2) (PDB ID- 7L13) from the PDB database. There are four (4) mutations on the protein. Mutated form of the protein was downloaded because mutation on this gene (LRRK2) is what triggers pathogenesis of PD. An established standard (Lrrk2-IN--1) which is an inhibitor of the Parkinson's disease kinase LRRK2 was also obtained from PubChem database. Fifteen (15) compounds extracted using hot water from safflower seed (Yu et al., 2013) were used as test compounds against the target protein. The structure of the compounds was obtained from the PubChem database. The target protein was prepared by removing water molecules, metal ion using the Pymol software. The test compounds (ligands) were concatenated with the Open babel software. Docking was done on PyRx while Discovery study was used to carry out the visualization study. 
To further validate these results, ligand based pharmacophores were applied using MoE.  A list of potent inhibitors for the target protein was downloaded which formed a pharmacophore model to classify the plant compounds; the results gave 13 hits from these showing their promise in Parkinson’s disease treatment.

  In this tutorial, you will perform docking of ligands into the N-terminus of Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90). The tools used for docking are based on the open-source software
