# Multiple Ligand Docking and MD Simulation Tutorial on leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 using compounds of Safflower plant as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson’s Disease

## Introduction
 
 
  This tutorial is on the use of PyRx to conduct multiple ligand docking and also the use of Galaxy to run Moleular Dynamics (MD) simulation. The study was carried out taking as reference this [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIk6ISuS5Lk) for the PyRx tutorial. The work flow as shown below.
  
  ## Workflow for Multiple Ligand docking
  In this tutorial, we will cover:
  
  1. Download data       
  2. Separating protein and unique ligand structures using [Discovery Studio](https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studio-visualizer-download)
  4. Docking using [PyRx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrx/)
  5. Visualization using [Discovery Studio](https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studio-visualizer-download)
 
 ### Download data 
  1. Get the target protein (mutated LRRK2) from the [PDB Protein data bank](https://www.rcsb.org/)
  2. Get the standard (Lrrk2-IN--1) and Ligands (15 Safflower compounds) from the [PubChem database](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
    
 ### Get the target protein
  1. Go to Protein Data Bank - **PDB**.
  2. Download the PDB file of ["**7LI3**"](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7LI3) - Structure of the LRRK2 G2019S mutant  
  
  
 ### Get the standard (Lrrk2-IN--1) and Ligands (15 Safflower compounds)
  1. Go to PubChem Database.
  2. Search for ["**LRRK2-IN-1**"](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/46843906) (PubChem ID: 46843906)
  3. List of ["**Journal source of Safflower compounds**"](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24288028/)
  4. Search for the Safflower ligands from PubChem and download the SDF file:
  
 ### Separating protein and unique ligand structures
  Simply filter the original PDB twice: once for lines which do not match, which returns a PDB file 
  containing only protein; and once for lines which match, which returns a PDB  file containing only the unique ligand.

### Preparing the target protein
  1. open the protein in [Biovia Discovery Studio](https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-studio-visualizer-download)
  2. click on view and hirarchy for better analyzation
  3. remove water and HETATM molecules by clicking on edit and delete one after the other
  4. Add hydrogen atom "click on chemistry, hydrogen, add".
  5. Save the file in PDB format. 
 
 ### Docking on PyRx
  1. Docking was done on [PyRx](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyrx/)
  2. Load the prepared protein
  3. Right click on the name of the protein, click on autodock and make macromolecule. It converts from PDB to PDBQT format
  4. Use Open babel in PyRx to import the ligands one after the other
  5. Minimize the energy for all the ligand
  6. Convert the ligands to PDBQT format
  7. Click on Vina wizard, select the protein and ligand
  8. Click on forward and the docking starts
  9. Save docking result in Excel

 ### Analysis of docking result using discovery studio
  1. open the docked protein
  2. click on ligand interactions on the left side of the panel
  3. study the 2D and 3D diagram generated 
  4. On the leftside panel to view all types of interactions occuring between the protein and the ligand.
  5. Repoart the findings.

 ## Using Galaxy for protein (LRRK2) MD simulations
Even though molecular docking gives a comprehensive insight about the non-covalent interactions between a small molecule ligand and the target receptor; it is still not enough to accurately validate the nature of binding between them. As it doesn't consider the cell's environment with the water molecules it includes in the cytosol and how it affects the local minimum binding free energy. For this reason molecular dynamics simulations are needed to accurately calculate the binding energies in the cellular environment using simplified molecular mechanics calculations by iterative application of Newton’s laws of motion. Multiple packages exist for performing MD simulations. One of the most popular visualization tools is the open-source GROMACS.

When using the LRRK2 (PDB ID: 7LI3) protein in galaxy, the GROMACS tool gives an error message that details to: "This job was terminated because it used more memory than it was allocated." as shown in figure 5. We believe this is a limitation to using GROMACS from galaxy. 

**Fig 5.** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88295292/130263657-7d87f51a-4c68-432d-936e-3b1ddef87710.png)


Instead the lysozyme protein workflow was regenerated to describe realistic molecular motion of the system.  

## Workflow for Galaxy
The following workflow (https://usegalaxy.eu/u/shadwa_7/h/md) was executed using PDB: 1AKI as shown in the figure below. This workflow was extracted from the following Galaxy tutorial: https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/computational-chemistry/tutorials/md-simulation-gromacs/tutorial.html#process 

**Fig 6.** workflow ![worflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88459663/130258174-60e498fd-4677-497c-9b53-40d06d319110.PNG)

1. Setup (loading data, solvation i.e. addition of water and ions).
2. Energy minimization of the protein.
3. Equilibration of the solvent around the protein (with two ensembles, NVT and NPT)
4. Production simulation.

## Setup 
In the setup step, a topology for the protein structure is prepared which contains all the information required to describe the molecule for the purposes of simulation (atom masses, bond lengths and angles, charges). Then, a GRO structure file is created, storing the structure of the protein. Finally, a ‘position restraint file’ is created which will define the unit cell where the simulation will take place. After that, protein solvation is executed to add water molecules and ions to the simulation box.

## Energy minimization
To remove any steric clashes or unusual geometry which would artificially raise the energy of the system, we must relax the structure by running an energy minimization (EM) algorithm.

## Equilibration
At this point equilibration of the solvent around the solute (i.e. the protein) is necessary. This is performed in two stages: equilibration under an NVT ensemble, followed by an NPT ensemble. NVT ensemble maintains constant number of particles, volume and temperature, while NPT ensemble maintains constant number of particles, pressure and temperature. Additionally, we use the position restraint file again to hold the protein in place while the solvent is allowed to move freely around it.

## Production simulation
After the previous steps, results of the MD simulation are now ready in the form of .GRO file which are visualized using NGL viewer.

## Summary
This tutorial aimed to conduct an in silico study , which involves using computer software to analyze biological data in vitro by mimicking what happens in vivo and using the plant as an alternative therapy, with a reduced side effect. The use of in silico technique is faster and reduces laboratory costs. The plant of interest is "Safflower". Safflower (*Carthamus tinctorius* L.) has long been used to treat cerebrovascular diseases in China. This plant contains flavonoids, which are effective in models of neurodegenerative disease (Ablat et al., 2016). 

From the docking study using PyRx, Epigallocatechin gallate (PDB ID- 65064) and Quercetin (PDB ID- 5280343) has the highest binding affinity compared to other compounds and the standard. They both produced nine (9) poses while the standard had one (1) pose. Visualization study showed compound 65064 to have best interaction. Unfavorable acceptor-acceptor interaction exist on 5280343 and the standard compound also has unfavorable bump. Galaxy was futher used to carry out molecular simulation on the target protein but failed.
